                    Humans of New York (HONY) is a photoblog and book of street portraits and
                    interviews collected on the streets of New York City. Started in November 2010
                    by photographer Brandon Stanton, Humans of New York has developed a large
                    following through social media. The blog had over 18 million followers on
                    Facebook[1] and around 7.5 million followers on Instagram as of December
                    2017.[2] As of March 2015, the book had spent 31 weeks on The New York Times
                    Best Seller list.[3] Hundreds of "Humans of" blogs have since been developed by
                    people in different cities around the world influenced by HONY.[4]</p>

            <div class="container__three--three">
                <p>Brandon Stanton started his blog in November 2010.[10][11] Initially, he
                    planned to gather 10,000 portraits of New Yorkers and plot them on a map of the
                    city. The project soon evolved, however, when Stanton started having
                    conversations with his subjects and including small quotes and stories alongside
                    his photographs.[12] With this new format, the blog began to grow rapidly. In a
                    matter of months, HONY became so popular that when Stanton accidentally updated
                    his Facebook status by tapping his phone's Q key, his post garnered 73 likes
                    within a minute.[13] As of December 2016, Humans of New York has more than 18
                    million likes on its Facebook page.[14] He also has over 590,000 followers on
                    Twitter.[15]</p>

                    “My mother lost her eyesight slowly. At first her eyes began to change colors.
                    The doctor told us that she needed a surgery, and I promised her I’d get the
                    money. It was my dream to save her eyesight. I did some repair work. I helped
                    our neighbors with construction projects. But I ran out of time and she went
                    completely blind. Soon afterwards she fell very sick. She had to stay in bed for
                    months. I was always there by her side. Even if there were a lot of people at
                    home, she only felt at peace if I was next to her. I cleaned her. I fed her. I
                    put my number on speed dial so she could call me at work. Toward the end she
                    began to imagine things. My family thought she was losing her mind, but I think
                    she was just lonely in the dark. She told me that she saw children. She told me
                    there were princes coming for her. I’d sit and talk with her about the things
                    she saw. I kept talking to her after she fell into a coma. I prayed with her. I
                    asked her to forgive my father. I asked her to forgive me for not saving her
                    eyesight. I didn’t have the money. But I gave her all that I could, which was my
                    service.”(Jakarta, Indonesia)

                    “I feel like God has given me a talent for art, and using that talent is a form
                    of gratitude. For years I worked in an automotive workshop. I’d try to paint
                    when I came home, but I never had any energy left. So I finally quit. Now I have
                    more freedom to develop my talents, but it hasn’t been easy. Art is more
                    difficult in this country. It’s not really seen as a profession. It would be
                    easier if I was alone, but I have a family to support so there’s a lot of
                    pressure to earn. I’m trying to be tough in poverty. I read a lot of poetry to
                    give me strength. I would never beg, so right now I’m drawing portraits and
                    caricatures to support myself. I’d rather be painting what I think and feel, but
                    I have to fulfill what the consumer wants.”(Jakarta, Indonesia)

                    “He had a heart attack at the office. He was only forty years old. We’d left the
                    house together that morning, but he never came home. I was in shock. They told
                    me to cry but I couldn’t. I lost so much weight. My children were still so young
                    and I knew I’d have to fight alone. I’d let my husband pamper me for my entire
                    life. We were always together. There were so many things I didn’t understand
                    because he’d taken care of everything. He’d always driven us everywhere. I’d
                    fall asleep in the car the moment we got on the highway. So I had to learn to
                    read maps, and figure out directions, and how to wait for the bus. It made me so
                    nervous when the crowd started pushing, but I learned to push too. I learned to
                    go to the pharmacy and wait in line. It seems so simple, but my husband had
                    always been the one who went to the pharmacy. I had to teach myself all these
                    things. But God made it easy for me. The time has passed so fast. I supported us
                    by working as a teacher and I’ve educated both my children. Now they’re teachers
                    themselves. And my daughter is getting married this Saturday. My son is going to
                    walk her down the aisle.” (Jakarta, Indonesia)

                    told me that she’d left with someone else. She told me the guy was just a
                    friend. But over the next few months, I started to hear more and more things.
                    Somebody saw her coming out of a hotel with another man. Then a few weeks later
                    I discovered them on a beach together. Then finally I came home early one day

                    I’ve saved a lot of money. I’m doing better than I ever have before. My plan was
                    to become successful and win my wife back, but my daughter tells me that she’s
                    already remarried. So I’m hoping to meet someone else. One of my customers was
                    left by her husband. She also has older children. We’ve been talking on the
                    phone a lot lately.” (Jakarta, Indonesia)
